## Welcome to my website

My name is Ngoc Anh Ngo (b. 1996) and I am a Czech-born Vietnamese economist. Growing up in a bilingual environment, I am passionate about building bridges between different spheres. In education, I have experienced Danish, British and Czech approaches, always aiming at taking the best of all worlds. I have worked in both public and private sectors, utilising my skills to be a valuable team member.

Currently, I work as a Junior Researcher at the Czech National Bank and am a third-year PhD student at the [Technical University of Ostrava](https://www.vsb.cz/personCards/personCard.jsp?lang=cs&person=NGO0008) under the supervision of [Martin Hodula](https://www.cnb.cz/en/economic-research/research-economists/Martin-Hodula/). I have received an individual regional scholarship to support my studies, as well as I have been participating in various research projects, either as a co-investigator or more recently as the principal investigator and main coordinator. 

My research is mainly in the areas of financial stability, non-bank financial intermediation and applied macroeconomics. At the university, I teach Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Economics of Developing Countries courses for Bachelor students.
